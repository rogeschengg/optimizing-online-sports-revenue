In this project, I'll be getting into the details of an online sports clothing company's product data. The goal is to come up with recommendations to increase their revenue.

Here are some questions that I thought are important to be answered:

1) How do Nike and Adidas product prices compare?
2) Is there a difference in discount amounts between the two brands?
3) Any link between revenue and product reviews, and how strong is it?
4) Does the length of a product's description affect its rating and reviews?
5) Spotting any trends or gaps in monthly review volumes?
6) Checking out the proportion of the company's stock that's footwear and the median revenue it brings in.
7) Comparing the median revenue of footwear to clothing.

I'll be using specific SQL skills such as aggregation, summarizing, truncating, cleaning, labeling, casting, common table expressions, correlation, and working with dates and times.
